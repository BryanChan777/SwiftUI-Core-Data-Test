# SwiftUI-Core-Data-Test
Sample program to demonstrate how CoreData can be used with SwiftUI.

This project currently compiles and runs on Beta 6.

The key component of this sample is the class CoreDataDataSource which performs
the basically the same function as the @FetchRequest property wrapper.

This sample has been sort of a play ground to try some other UI ideas using SwiftUI.
