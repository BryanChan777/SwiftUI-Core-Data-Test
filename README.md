# SwiftUI-Core-Data-Data-Source
Extended sample program to demonstrate how CoreData can be used with SwiftUI.

This project currently compiles and runs on Beta 6.

The key component of this sample is the class CoreDataDataSource which encapsulates
much of the functionality of an NSFetchedResultsController for use with SwiftUI.

This sample has been sort of a play ground to try some other UI ideas using SwiftUI.
